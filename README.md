## Introduction
Just a messy edit of Fantome, by [addy-dclxvi](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi), which is a messy edit of the Arc GTK theme.
I liked the simplicity of Fantome, but I wanted the colorscheme of Arc-Dark.
Therefore, I created this variant.

## Preview
I use Compiz as my window manager.
The icons theme used is Arc-X-D, with Paper as a fallback.
Metacity theme is Arc-Dark.

## Notes (from original Fantome)

- Panel frame is a bloat, so I remove it.

- Combo entry is a bloat, so I remove it. But don't worry, there will be an outline when it's selected.

- Scrollbar placeholder is a bloat, so I remove it. Don't worry, the scrollbar itself remains visible.

- Progressbar placeholder is a bloat, so I remove it. Don't worry, the progressbar itself remains visible.

- Tab button is a bloat, so I replace it with simple underline for top and bottom tab. And sideline for left and right tab.

- Multiple background colour is a bloat, so I unify the colour. #ffffff for light theme and #2f343f for dark theme.

- Button actually is a bloat, previously I completely remove the Button Pixmap. 
But it breaks my workflow, especially when I deal with an app with so many buttons like GIMP. 
So, now I made the button only visible as a thin outline for inactive button. And slight highlight for active button.

- GTK CSD is the best example of bloat. It breaks some compositing effect, like multiple shadow, wrong transparency, and having hide, maximize, & close buttons in tiling window manager which is ridiculous. 
I recommend You to remove it using gtk-nocsd (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

- Just like any dark theme. Sometimes it breaks web browsing experience, and I don't know how to fix it.

- I designed this theme for myself. So I use "It works for me" philosophy. Don't complain if it doesn't work for You :p

- Folder icons are included as a bonus.
